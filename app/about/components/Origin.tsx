          Honestly, in Minnesota we have a shortage of suitable pet dogs for the
          average family. While we handle this by shipping dogs into our state
          to help out overburdened shelters and rescues in the southern states,
          I also wanted to contribute to the pet dog population by providing
          health-tested, social, thoughtfully-raised puppies to our community.
