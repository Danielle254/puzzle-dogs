She’s an under-the-covers snuggler with low exercise needs (she’s happy to veg for months at a time when my health issues flare up) but high exercise tolerance (if I feel up to hiking up a mountain, she’s game!). She’s naughty in the funniest ways, and easy to train for food, toys, or personal play.",
