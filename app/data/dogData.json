    "about": "Biz is my go-anywhere, up-for-anything girl! She’s traveled across the country with us three times, and is the perfect road trip buddy. She’s an under-the-covers snuggler with low exercise needs (she’s happy to veg for months at a time when my health issues flare up) but high exercise tolerance (if I feel up to hiking up a mountain, she’s game!). She’s naughty in the funniest ways, and easy to train for food, toys, or personal play.",

    "about": "Pan is the Goodest of Boys(™)! He’s modeled professionally for Target and Publisher’s Clearinghouse, and is the perfect neutral dog for CGC tests or reactive dog classes. He’s a smiler, and loves to give hugs and press his face against your face to get as close as possible. He’s easy to live with and train, and is just all around the sweetest and most stable little guy. *neutered at age nine; three frozen breedings remaining to select pairings",
